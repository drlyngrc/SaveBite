## ‚öôÔ∏è Code Implementation

The development of SaveBite involved the use of modern programming languages and frameworks to ensure a robust, scalable, and maintainable system. Each technology was chosen for its ability to streamline development and enhance system performance. Below is a summary of the key technologies used:

- **Programming Languages:**
  - **JavaScript:** Utilized for both front-end and back-end development. It enabled dynamic web interactions and seamless integration between components.

- **Frameworks and Libraries:**
  - **Node.js:** Powered the back-end, handling server-side logic and API endpoints efficiently.
  - **Express.js:** Simplified the creation of RESTful APIs and managed routes effectively.
  - **Firebase:** Served as the database and authentication platform, providing real-time synchronization and secure user management.

- **Development Tools:**
  - **GitHub:** Facilitated version control, team collaboration, and code management throughout the development process.
  - **Postman:** Used for testing API endpoints and verifying the functionality of back-end services.
  
- **Architecture:**
  The system followed a modular structure, separating concerns into different files and models. Key modules included:
  - **User Management:** Handled user registration, authentication, and profile management.
  - **Order Processing:** Managed order placement, tracking, and history.
  - **Payment Integration:** Ensured secure handling of transactions and balance management.
  - **Product Catalog:** Allowed sellers to add food items and buyers to browse the available products.

The implementation process emphasized clean code practices, modular development, and continuous integration, ensuring the system remained flexible for future enhancements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Challenges and Solutions  

During the development of SaveBite, the team faced several challenges. Creating accurate UML diagrams required multiple revisions to ensure alignment with the system‚Äôs functionality. Tight deadlines made balancing tasks difficult, but task delegation and regular check-ins helped keep the project on track. Implementing the code structure, integrating modules, and handling errors posed complexities, which were resolved through incremental development, pair programming, and systematic debugging. Designing a user-friendly interface required balancing aesthetics with functionality. Lastly, coordinating among team members with different schedules was challenging, but maintaining open communication improved collaboration. These experiences highlighted the importance of clear communication, incremental development, and adaptability when tackling unexpected hurdles.
